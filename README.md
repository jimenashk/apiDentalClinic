# backend_final_go

## Challenge
The final challenge of the "Backend III" course in the "Certified Tech Developer" program at Digital House entails developing a REST API in Go for a dental clinic's appointment booking system.

## Objective
The project aims to create an application that enables the management of data related to Dentists, Patients, and Appointments. The API will provide endpoints to handle operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting appointments, as well as managing information about dentists and patients. The implementation will involve designing appropriate data models, establishing database connections, handling authentication and authorization, and ensuring proper validation of input data. The goal is to develop a reliable and efficient API that meets the specific requirements of a dental clinic's appointment management system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go installed on your machine

### Installation

1. Execute the `dentalClinic.sql` script located in the root directory of the project to create the necessary tables in the database.

2. In the `cmd` folder, run the following command to start the application:

```
