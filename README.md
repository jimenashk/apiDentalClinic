## Goal ✨
The project aims to create an application that enables the management of data related to Dentists, Patients, and Appointments. The API will provide endpoints to handle operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting appointments, as well as managing information about dentists and patients. The implementation will involve designing appropriate data models, establishing database connections, handling authentication and authorization, and ensuring proper validation of input data. The goal is to develop a reliable and efficient API that meets the specific requirements of a dental clinic's appointment management system.
